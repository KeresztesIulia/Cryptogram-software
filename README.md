# Cryptogram-software
 A cryptogram creator software and a custom cryptogram solver game. The two were designed as a pair and are supposed to be used between friends to generate and solve texts encrypted with a substitution cypher.

## KRIPTOGR
A software that lets you encrypt a text using a simple subtitution cypher. It gives the possibility to bring back the last encrypted text for double-checking.

**Note**:
- does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase
- the encrypted text is uppercase
- accepts letters from the English and Hungarian alphabet, as well as punctuation and numbers (the latter two will not be encrypted)

## Kryptogr solver game
A software inpired by the several cryptogram solver games available on Android, where a substitution cypher is used, and you can decode the text letter by letter, with the game substituting each corresponding letter with the one written by the user. In this version, you can input any custom encrypted text you receive (or find).

**Note**: there is no way to check the correctness of a solution, since this is custom text, and this function would require the user to know the answer beforehand.
